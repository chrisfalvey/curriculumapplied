# Information and Communications Technologies
*Digital Technologies*

***DRAFT ONLY***

## Overview

The following document represents a learning program of 10 weeks. Reverse planned from the *Victorian Curriculum*, three units introduce students to scaffolded understanding accross each of the three sub-strands of the *Digtial Technologies* domain. Utilising *Apple Swift Playgrounds*, *Sphero Edu*, and *Obsidian* as core resources, alternative substitutions are also detailed for unit adaptation.
