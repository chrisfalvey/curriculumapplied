## Explicit Teaching 

**Objective:** Students will learn to read and understand different types of maps. 

## Content and Activities: 

Introduction to Key Terms (20 minutes): 

**Map:** A visual representation of an area showing geographic features, roads, landmarks, and other elements. 

**Scale:** Indicates the relationship between distances on the map and actual distances on the ground. 

**Legend:** A key that explains the symbols and colours used on the map. 

**Compass Directions:** North (N), South (S), East (E), and West (W), used to describe directions on a map. 

**Topographic Map:** Shows the elevation and contour of the land, indicating mountains, valleys, and plains. 

**Street Map:** Displays roads, streets, and urban infrastructure, often used for navigation within towns and cities. 

**Thematic Map:** Focuses on specific themes such as population density, climate, or economic activities. 

## Exploring Different Types of Maps (30 minutes): 

### Topographic Maps: 

**Features:** Contour lines indicating elevation changes, symbols for natural and man-made features (rivers, mountains, roads). 

**Uses:** Hiking, planning construction projects, understanding landscape and terrain. 

What is the highest elevation point in Cobram according to the topographic map? 

Identify and describe the major natural features such as rivers and hills on the map. 

### Street Maps: 

Features: Detailed road networks, street names, locations of buildings, and important landmarks. 

Uses: Navigation, urban planning, locating addresses and services. 

What are the main roads connecting different parts of Cobram? 

Locate and list the key landmarks such as schools, parks, and hospitals. 

### Thematic Maps: 

Features: Data visualization based on specific themes like population density, climate, or economic activities, often using colour gradients and symbols. 

Uses: Analysing demographic trends, environmental studies, policy planning, and resource management. 

Which direction is North? 

What does the key/Legend tell us? 

What is the theme of the map? 

High/low rainfall areas? 

Case Study: Cobram in Moira Shire (30 minutes) 

Activity: Select Cobram as the local town for exploration. Use different maps to analyse Cobram's geographic features, road networks, and demographic data. 

## Catch Up Lessons 

### Thematic Maps 

Identify the Theme: Look at the thematic map provided. What is the main theme or topic shown on this map? (e.g., population density, climate zones, land use) 

Legend Interpretation: Use the legend on the thematic map to answer this question: What do the different colors or symbols represent? Choose two colors or symbols and explain what they indicate. 

Comparing Areas: Compare two different areas on the thematic map. How do they differ according to the map's theme? (e.g., if it's a climate map, compare the climate zones of two regions) 

Find and Explain: Find a specific location on the thematic map. Describe the information provided about this location according to the map's theme. Why might this information be important? 

Drawing Conclusions: Based on the information from the thematic map, what conclusions can you draw about the overall pattern or distribution shown? (e.g., areas with high population density, regions with similar climates) 

### Topographic Maps 

Understanding Contours: Look at the topographic map of Voss. What do the contour lines represent? Explain how you can tell if the terrain is steep or flat. 

Finding Elevation: Find a specific point on the map (use grid references if needed). What is the elevation at this point? How did you determine this? 

Identifying Features: Identify at least two physical features on the map (e.g., mountains, rivers). Describe where they are located using the map's grid references. 

Map Scale: The scale of the map is 1:25,000. What does this scale mean? How would you use this scale to measure the real distance between two points on the map? 

Interpreting Symbols: Look at the map's legend and identify three different symbols used. What does each symbol represent? Find one example of each symbol on the map. 

### Street Maps (Albury/Wodonga) 

Identifying Locations: 

Find the location of the Albury Botanic Gardens on Google Maps. What is the exact address? 

Exploring Features: 

Locate the Wodonga Plaza on Google Maps. What are three types of stores or services you can find there? 

Giving Directions: 

Starting at the Albury Railway Station, provide directions to the Murray Art Museum Albury (MAMA). Include street names and any major landmarks you pass by. 

Giving Directions: 

Starting from Wodonga Senior Secondary College, provide directions to the Belvoir Park Playground. Include street names and any major intersections. 

Measuring Distance: 

Use the measuring tool on Google Maps to find the distance between Albury High School and Albury Library Museum. What is the distance in kilometers? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Answers for Thematic Maps Questions 

Identify the Theme: 

The main theme or topic shown on the thematic map is population density. 

Legend Interpretation: 

Example 1: The color dark red represents areas with high population density. 

Example 2: The color light yellow represents areas with low population density. 

Comparing Areas: 

Area 1 (urban region): High population density, indicated by dark red color. 

Area 2 (rural region): Low population density, indicated by light yellow color. 

These areas differ significantly, with the urban region being densely populated and the rural region being sparsely populated. 

Find and Explain: 

Location: A major city marked on the map. 

The thematic map shows that this city has a high population density. This information is important for urban planning and resource allocation. 

Drawing Conclusions: 

Conclusion: The map shows that population density is highest in urban areas and lowest in rural areas. This pattern suggests that people tend to live closer together in cities and spread out more in the countryside. 

 

Answers for Topographic Maps Questions 

Understanding Contours: 

Contour lines represent elevation above sea level. 

Close contour lines indicate steep terrain, while widely spaced contour lines indicate flat terrain. 

Finding Elevation: 

Point: Located at grid reference 58, 25. 

Elevation: 200 meters. 

Determined by finding the point's contour line and reading the elevation marked. 

Identifying Features: 

Feature 1: Mountain - Located at grid reference 60, 24. 

Feature 2: River - Runs through grid references 57, 22 to 60, 26. 

Map Scale: 

Scale 1:25,000 means 1 unit on the map equals 25,000 units in real life. 

To measure real distance: If the distance between two points on the map is 4 cm, the real distance is 4 cm x 25,000 = 100,000 cm or 1 km. 

Interpreting Symbols: 

Symbol 1: Triangle - Represents a peak or summit. Example: Peak at grid reference 59, 23. 

Symbol 2: Blue line - Represents a river. Example: River at grid reference 58, 24. 

Symbol 3: Dashed line - Represents a trail or path. Example: Trail at grid reference 61, 25.
